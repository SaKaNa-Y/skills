# Verification Traces

Read this reference before assigning the first `Verified` state. A Verification Trace is the positive evidence that a Capability Journey reached its user outcome; an entry point, rendered container, opened control, success label, or source claim alone is insufficient.

## Prove the Journey

Keep one compact trace per independently verifiable capability. Identify:

- the capability and user outcome;
- the public interface, relevant initial state, fixture, and prerequisites;
- the material user actions, including meaningful inputs, selections, and applicable pointing and keyboard paths;
- for an interactive UI, the material rendered control states inspected along those actions and any browser- or operating-system-owned visual state that remained unobservable;
- the observable result, settled state, artifact, or downstream effect;
- the Discriminating Variation and its contrasting result, or why no material variation applies; and
- the modes covered by the completed journey and any Mode Parity Probes.

Use `Finding` when actual use confirms a product or documentation problem. Use `Blocked` when a missing safe prerequisite or control surface prevents the journey. Keep the capability `Not Exercised` when the journey or its required evidence remains incomplete.

## Keep the Evidence Compact

Store the trace with its capability in the Coverage Ledger as a short paragraph, structured row, or equally compact record. Preserve exact commands, output excerpts, screenshots, logs, or viewport details only when they materially establish the result; Finding Packets own the fuller evidence for problems.

Prefer observable contrasts. For example, a filter trace records two meaningful inputs and the different result sets they produced, not every pointer movement used to reach the control.

**Complete when:** another agent can identify the exercised public journey, distinguish its two outcomes or understand the variation exclusion, and repeat the verification without relying on implementation source.
